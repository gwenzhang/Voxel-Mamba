# Installation

### Requirements
All the codes are tested in the following environment:
* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
* Python 3.8
* PyTorch 1.12.0
* CUDA 11.6
* [`spconv v1.0 (commit 8da6f96)`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv/tree/8da6f967fb9a054d8870c3515b1b44eca2103634) or [`spconv v1.2`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv) or [`spconv v2.x`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv)

* Install the SparseConv library, we use the implementation from [`[spconv]`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv). 
    * If you use PyTorch 1.1, then make sure you install the `spconv v1.0` with ([commit 8da6f96](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv/tree/8da6f967fb9a054d8870c3515b1b44eca2103634)) instead of the latest one.
    * If you use PyTorch 1.3+, then you need to install the `spconv v1.2`. As mentioned by the author of [`spconv`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv), you need to use their docker if you use PyTorch 1.4+. 
    * You could also install latest `spconv v2.x` with pip, see the official documents of [spconv](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv).
  
b. Install this `pcdet` library and its dependent libraries by running the following command:
```shell
python setup.py develop
```
c. Install this `mamba-ssm` library and its dependent libraries by running the following command:
```shell
